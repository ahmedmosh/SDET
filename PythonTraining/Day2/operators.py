# python language like many other languages supports operators
# operators are a symbol which will perform an operation between 2 or more variables.
# they are of different types it includes:

# Arithmetic operators

a = 8
b = 3

print(a + b)  # this performs addition of a, b
print(a - b)  # this performs a subtraction operation
print(a / b)  # this performs mathematical division showing remainders
print(a // b)  # this performs division and returns quotient value
print(a % b)  # this returns the remainder
print(a ** b)  # this raises the variables to a power value

# Relational operators/comparison operators : > < <= >= !=
# Relational operators returns a boolean value True/False

c = 5
d = 10

print(c > d)  # returns False
print(d > d)  # returns True
print(c == d)  # returns False
print(c != d)  # returns True
print(c >= d)  # returns False
print(c <= d)  # returns True

# Logical operators : and or not
# logical operators return boolean value

e = True
f = False

print(e and f)
print(e or f)
print(not e)
